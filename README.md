## :octopus: About Me

<img align='right' src='documentation/images/musuyaba-logo.png' width='200"'>

I am a curious and enthusiastic person who loves to explore new things and learn from others. I have always been fascinated by the power of programming languages, algorithms, and computational methods to create solutions for real-world problems. I enjoy the challenge of developing programs that work as expected and the thrill of discovering new knowledge along the way.

I have also been involved in various organizations and communities that have enriched my skills and experiences in creativity, leadership, problem-solving, and teamwork. I value the opportunity to collaborate with people who share my passions and interests, as well as those who have different perspectives and backgrounds.

I don't have a specific hobby, but I like to spend my time taking care of myself and working on projects that interest me. Some of the topics that I am currently interested in are the Internet of Things, Computer Vision, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Server Administrator, and Web Development. I am always eager to learn more about these fields and apply them to real-world scenarios.

I hope this text gives you an idea of who I am and what I do, feel free to reach out to me.
